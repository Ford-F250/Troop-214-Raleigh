Most of these free bars, or web page dividers, have complementary buttons. 
They are shown here in their full dimensions (wider than 460 pixels, which 
is the width of the table in this case :-0!) The width of some bars can be 
adjusted in HTML without distortion (be sure to check how this works in 
Netscape - it won't). Others can only be adjusted by manipulating the 
graphic in a paint program. You'll have to experiment a little bit to find 
the right width for your application. 


You may control the width by setting the number of pixels: 
<img src="goldline.gif" width="495"> 
Or you may choose a percentage of the page width using: 
<img src="goldline.gif" width="?%"> 

Using a percentage will cause the bar to expand or shrink relative to the 
viewing width of the browser screen.
