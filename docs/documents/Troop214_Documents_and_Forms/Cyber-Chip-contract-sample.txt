A Scout-Parent Digital Technology Contract

My parents may allow me to use a digital technology if I agree to rules for using it. I understand that I must abide by these rules or the device will be taken away from me for as long as my parents choose.

The rules include, but are not limited to, the following.

•	I will not use technology devices after a time in the evening designated by my parents. For the purpose of this contract that time will be called “bedtime.” On school nights that time is ______________. On non-school nights that time is _____________. This will be revised from time to time, either earlier or later, depending on my age and how well I respect the rules of this agreement.

If my phone rings while I am driving, I will not answer it. I will wait and return calls and texts either when I have reached my destination or can pull over safely.
•	Any abusive use of this technology will mean I will lose this or all technology privileges for a period of time.

I understand that if I create, send, or receive text messages of any young person, including myself, in which the young person is depicted nude, semi-nude, or engaging in sexual behavior, that I am violating child pornography laws and could be charged with breaking child pornography laws. I understand that this kind of behavior has caused young people to be charged with crimes and to be permanently listed on sex-offender registries.
