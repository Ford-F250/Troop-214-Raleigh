On June 22nd Friday, Troop 214 went to James River State Park in Virginia. It was a two day trip with 26 people. We went canoeing for 7.5 miles downstream with a maximum of class three rapids. We had 12 canoes and 2 kayaks. The trip was very fun and there was some exciting moments in the river. There was a 5 mile hike after. We returned on the 24th. Overall the trip was really fun. Nobody was lost and nobody got serious injuries.
